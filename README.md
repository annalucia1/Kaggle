# Zillow Prediction

This project is based on the Kaggle competition at https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1. The source data is provided by Zillow.

The target is to predict the difference between the log predicted price by Zillow (named Zestimate) and the log actual sale price of homes.

logerror = log(Zestimate) - log(SalePrice)
